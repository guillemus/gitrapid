## **AI Feature Planning Guide**

### **ðŸŽ¯ Purpose**
A systematic approach for AI agents to plan software features that prioritize user needs and clarity.

## **ðŸ“‹ Phase 1: Understand the Context**

### **1.1 Establish Foundation**
- **What problem does this solve?**
- **Who needs this and why?**
- **What are the key constraints?**

### **1.2 Ask Essential Questions**
- What do users actually need to accomplish?
- What information helps them make good decisions?
- What would make them feel confident?
- How can we simplify the experience?

## **ðŸ“‹ Phase 2: Analyze & Explore**

### **2.1 Assess Current State**
- What frustrates users now?
- Where does confusion come from?
- What are the main barriers?
- How will we measure success?

### **2.2 Generate Approaches**
- Create 3-5 different solutions
- Consider different ways to structure the experience
- Think about user mental models and expectations

### **2.3 Evaluate Options**
- How clear is each approach?
- How easy is it to use?
- Does it handle user needs?
- Can it be implemented well?

## **ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Design Principles**

### **3.1 Be Transparent**
- Show users what will happen
- Use clear, understandable language
- Make processes visible
- Provide information at the right time

### **3.2 Give Users Control**

- Avoid hidden defaults
- Show consequences of decisions
- Allow users to change their minds

### **3.3 Keep It Simple**
- Remove confusing elements
- Make next steps obvious
- Reduce information overload
- Streamline the user journey

## **ðŸ“‹ Phase 4: Document Clearly**

### **4.1 Structure**
```
ðŸŽ¯ Main Idea (1-2 sentences)
ðŸ“‹ Key Features (3-5 features)
ðŸŽ¨ User Experience (how it works)
ðŸ”„ User Flow (step-by-step)
ðŸŽ¯ Benefits (3-5 points)
```

### **4.2 Focus on Users**
- Write from user's perspective
- Use clear formatting
- Describe what users see and do
- Include specific examples

---

## **ðŸ“‹ Phase 5: Decision Framework**

### **5.1 User Needs First**
- Prioritize understanding over speed
- Build confidence through clarity
- Address user concerns directly
- Test assumptions about user knowledge

### **5.2 Balance Trade-offs**
- Control vs. simplicity
- Information vs. overwhelm
- Flexibility vs. ease of use
- Customization vs. cognitive load

---

## **ðŸ“‹ Phase 6: Planning Process**

### **6.1 Core Steps**
1. **Understand problems deeply**
2. **Generate multiple solutions**
3. **Prioritize user benefits**
4. **Document user experience**
5. **Validate with user goals**

### **6.2 Documentation Rules**
- User-first language
- Clear visual structure
- Concrete examples
- Focus on user benefits
- Avoid technical details

### **6.3 Quality Checks**
- Does this help users feel informed?
- Can users make good choices?
- Is this appropriately simple?
- Are all processes clear?

## **ðŸŽ¯ Simple Template**

```
## **Feature Name - What It Does**

### **ðŸŽ¯ Main Idea**
[1-2 sentences]

### **ðŸ“‹ Key Features**
[3-5 features with descriptions]

### **ðŸŽ¨ User Experience**
[How users interact with it]

### **ðŸ”„ User Flow**
[Step-by-step process]

### **ðŸŽ¯ Benefits**
[Why users will like it]
```

This approach ensures features are designed with users as the primary focus, creating experiences that are clear, trustworthy, and effective.
