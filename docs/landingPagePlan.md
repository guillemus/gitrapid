# GitRapid Landing Page Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Plan concise, high-impact landing page messaging for GitRapid, including 3â€“4 distinct content variants and a clear CTA to browse featured public repos by `owner/repo`.

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 1: Understand the Context

### 1.1 Establish Foundation

  - Developers, maintainers, reviewersâ€”anyone who reads code and triages daily and wants instant navigation.
- **What are the key constraints?**
  - Keep it familiar (GitHub-like style), minimal copy, clear CTA, show public featured repos, trustworthy data use.

### 1.2 Ask Essential Questions
- What do users need to accomplish?
  - Instantly try a repo, feel speed, decide to sign in.
- What information helps them decide?
  - Speed benefits, familiarity, safety/privacy, public demo without login.
- What would make them feel confident?
  - Read-only demos, transparent data use, known public repos, no surprises.
