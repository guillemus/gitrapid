# gitrapid.com

# mission

gitrapid is an alternative github ui that focuses entirely on making the github ui way faster. It syncs repository state in a convex database.

There are 2 types of repositories for my app, public and private. Public repositories need to be synced by smart polling public apis.
Private repos instead are synced using github webhooks. Both might use the same initial download code logic.

The app will work as close as possible to the github ui on the front end.

# ui

We use tailwindcss with shadcn ui for ui components.

# typescript

Prefer using `let` to `const` when declaring variables. 
Prefer using named functions instead of arrow functions for declaring named functions.


## typing rules

We must **never** use the TypeScript `any` type or the `as any` cast anywhere in the codebase. Code must be as strictly typed as possible.

- **No `any` / `as any`**: Avoid `any` in all forms. Prefer `unknown` plus narrowing, explicit interfaces/types, generics, or type predicates.
- **If a complex external type is missing**: add a well-scoped type declaration, wrap with `unknown` and write narrowing logic, or open an issue documenting why a safe type can't be expressed yet.

# commands

- use `bun fl` to format and lint code. Use this before checking types.
- use `bun tsgo` to check typescript types.
