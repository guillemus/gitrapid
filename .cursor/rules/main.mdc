# gitrapid.com

# mission

gitrapid is an alternative github ui that focuses entirely on making the github ui way faster. It syncs repository state in a convex database. 

The app will work as close as possible to the github ui on the front end.

# ui

We use tailwindcss with shadcn ui for ui components.

# typescript typing rules

We must **never** use the TypeScript `any` type or the `as any` cast anywhere in the codebase. Code must be as strictly typed as possible.

- **No `any` / `as any`**: Avoid `any` in all forms. Prefer `unknown` plus narrowing, explicit interfaces/types, generics, or type predicates.
- **If a complex external type is missing**: add a well-scoped type declaration, wrap with `unknown` and write narrowing logic, or open an issue documenting why a safe type can't be expressed yet.
